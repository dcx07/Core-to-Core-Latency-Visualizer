# C2C Latency Visualizer

A simple HTML tool to visualize core-to-core (C2C) latency data.

This tool is designed to process C2C latency data generated by [MicroBenchX](https://github.com/CXWorld/MicroBenchX).

## How to Use

1.  **Open `c2c.html`:** Open the `c2c.html` file in any modern web browser.
2.  **Paste Data:** Copy the C2C latency data from MicroBenchX (or similar tools) and paste it into the text area. The data should be a comma-separated matrix.

    **Example Data Format:**
    ```
    x, 10.5, 15.2, 20.1
    10.4, x, 21.0, 16.3
    15.1, 20.9, x, 12.5
    20.0, 16.2, 12.4, x
    ```

3.  **Visualize:** Click the "Visualize" button.
4.  **Analyze:** A heatmap will be generated, showing the latency between each pair of cores.
